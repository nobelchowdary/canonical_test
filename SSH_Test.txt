Objective:  
To verify that SSH connectivity is successful using both password and key-based authentication mechanisms.

Preconditions:  
1. SSH server is set up and running.
2. SSH client is installed on the test machine.
3. User account with password authentication is set up on the SSH server.
4. SSH private and public key pair is generated for key-based authentication.
5. Public key is added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the SSH server.


Test Steps (Password Authentication):

1. From the SSH client, attempt to connect to the SSH server using the user account and password:  
   `ssh username@ssh_server_ip_address`

2. When prompted, enter the correct password for the user account.


Expected Result (Password Authentication):
1. The connection should be established without any errors.
2. The terminal should display a message indicating successful login, and the user should be presented with the server's command prompt.

Test Steps (Key-Based Authentication)**:

1. From the SSH client, attempt to connect to the SSH server using key-based authentication:  
   `ssh -i /path/to/private_key username@ssh_server_ip_address`


Expected Result (Key-Based Authentication):
1. The connection should be established without prompting for a password.
2. The terminal should display a message indicating successful login, and the user should be presented with the server's command prompt.


Postconditions:  
1. User is logged out of the SSH server after the test.


Notes:
- Ensure the private key has restricted permissions (`chmod 600 /path/to/private_key`) to avoid potential unauthorized access.
- It's recommended to run this test in a controlled environment to prevent security risks.
